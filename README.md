# Homelab
> _"Learning happens in the lab"_
> General Grammar: Discovering and ordering facts of reality compromises basic, systematic **knowledge**.

## Who?
- I am a software engineer and cloud / Linux / Ops enthusiast.

## What?
- This is my personal learning lab for testing out ideas and discovering best practices.
- I want to solve scenarios that are both useful and interesting to me.

Scenarios:

1. Home server
    - Create universal solution to test and deploy a Linux server on an M1 laptop and spare-parts Linux PC.


## Where?
- I want my solutions to be portable and run on different hardware.  
- I want to test my solutions comfortably on my laptop and deploy them on my personal home server.
- Use virtualization and containerization for portability.

Hardware at my disposal:

- Macbook Pro M1 laptop
- Spare-parts PC running Linux
- Dell OptiPlex refurbished machines
- Cloud providers

## When?
- Focusing on this in my spare time, but doing it with a daily consistency.
- Write declarative infrastructure as code to create idempotent solutions.

## Why?
> Formal Logic: Developing the faculty of reason in establishing valid [i.e., non-contradictory] relationships among facts is systematic **understanding**.

- Find the single best solution for a given scenario.
- Solve practical needs of my home server and archive.
- Have the ability to audit security.

Learn technologies relevant for cloud engineering and Ops roles:

- Terraform
- Ansible
- Cloud-init
- Linux
- Linux administration
- Virtualization, VMs
- QEMU, libvirt, libvirtd, virtsh
- Containerization
- Podman, Docker
- Kubernetes
- Automation
- Cron jobs

## How?
> Classical Rhetoric: Applying knowledge and understanding expressively compromises **wisdom** or, in other words, it is systematically useable **knowledge and understanding**.

### 1. Home server
- Create a universal solution to test and deploy a Linux server on an M1 laptop and spare-parts Linux PC.

Features:
- persistent storage
- daily backups
- git server
- ssh access
- sftp
- cron jobs
